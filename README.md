imagine you're depressed and you vent.. but then you realize you did it in #general.. now not only are you depressed but you also have to copy every message and then delete the messages..

or imagine you have a server and people talk about anime in the #games channel.. unacceptable! but when you delete them they get upset and you get tired...

well now there's a solution! think of me like a truck; you call me with a command, i come, pick up the messages, go to whichever channel you want me to go, and drop the messages there! all in a second! and the best part is.. i don't run on fuel!

not to brag but im simple and im useful and i don't know why you still didn't add me to your server! (or beg your favorite server's owner to add me)

## commands
### /move_last_messages [message_count] [channel]
moves the last `message_count` messages (up to 20 messages) to the `channel` you pick.. simple as that!
