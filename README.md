# Relay-Bot Repository

Welcome to the Relay-Bot repository! This project is designed to help manage and organize your Discord server's channels by allowing messages to be moved between channels easily. The bot currently has two versions: one written in Rust and the other in TypeScript.

## Project Overview

Relay-Bot provides several commands to manage messages within your Discord server, including moving individual messages and moving messages along with all subsequent ones to a different channel. The bot ensures that permissions are properly handled and provides an interactive experience for selecting target channels.

### **Available Versions:**

- **Rust Version**: The original implementation of Relay-Bot, written in Rust. This version is designed for performance and memory safety.
  - [Rust README](./rust/README.md)

- **TypeScript Version**: A more accessible and maintainable version of Relay-Bot, written in TypeScript. This version leverages the Node.js ecosystem and provides an easier entry point for developers familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript.
  - [TypeScript README](./typescript/README.md)

## Getting Started
