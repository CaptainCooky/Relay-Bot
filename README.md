imagine you or people in your server talked about anime in the #games channel..

unacceptable! and now you have to copy every message to the right channel and
delete the messages and all.. even more unacceptable!

with me you can do all that with just one command

and no mods around? no problem, as long as everyone in the conversation agrees
to move the messages, i'll still move them

*due to discord limitations, the bot can't move messages sent before it joined, sorry..*
